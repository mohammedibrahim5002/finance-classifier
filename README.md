# 💳 ML Finance Transaction Classifier

A machine learning project that automatically classifies financial transactions into categories such as **Food, Travel, Bills, Grocery, and Entertainment** using transaction metadata.

This project demonstrates a **complete ML workflow** including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and model deployment readiness.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Personal finance apps often require transactions to be categorized manually.
This project builds a machine learning model that **automatically classifies financial transactions** based on attributes like amount, merchant type, payment method, and device used.

Automating this task improves:

* expense tracking
* budgeting insights
* financial analytics

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

The model was trained using a **Gradient Boosting Classifier** to predict the category of a transaction.

### Features Used

* `Amount`
* `PaymentMethod`
* `AccountType`
* `DeviceUsed`
* `MerchantType`

### Target Variable

* `Category`
  (Transaction label such as Food, Travel, Bills, etc.)

## ⚙️ Model Performance

| Metric            | Score    |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Accuracy          | **82%**  |
| Average Precision | **~84%** |
| Average Recall    | **~81%** |
| Weighted F1 Score | **~80%** |

The model performs well across multiple transaction categories while maintaining balanced performance.
